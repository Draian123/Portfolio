						Hi there!, Iâ€™m Dennis, a junior fullstack software developer.
					</p>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						Throughout my life, technology and computers have always held a special appeal for me.
						The intricate nature of programming never fails to captivate my attention, 
						driving me to delve deeper into this fascinating field. As a result, I embarked on a journey 
						of learning JavaScript and eventually took the step of enrolling in Ironhacks Web Development 
						Bootcamp, a highly renowned program in America and internationally.
					</p>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						Dedication to continuous learning is at the core of my values, 
						firmly believing that one should never cease expanding their knowledge.
					</p>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						Always on the lookout for fresh opportunities to broaden my understanding of the internet and
						web development, you&apos;ll often find me locked into my laptop, sipping a bottle of club mate. 
						My ultimate aspiration is to join a team of talented individuals, from whom I can learn 
						and collaborate with to build captivating digital experiences.
